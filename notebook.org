This notebook is used to track current goals and activities in the
project. It is not an issue tracker (we use GitHub for that). It is a
place to record current activity, successes and failures and near term
plans. A lab notebook if you like.

For best results edit in Emacs Org mode.

* TODO Demo150-publish-on-success

This will be an extension of Demo140. The goal is to push updated
images to DockerHub (tagged with "dev").

** TODO Push container to Docker Hub

*** DONE Create Docker Hub Organization called "ADTD"

https://hub.docker.com/u/adtd/dashboard/teams/owners/




*** DONE Manually push containers to the new org from the test machine

  - [X] Create a repository for each of the containers
    - [X] web
    - [X] rest
    - [X] integration_test
    - [X] load_test
  - [X] Manually push a "dev" tagged versio of each container
    - [X] web
    - [X] rest
    - [X] integration_test
    - [X] load_test





*** TODO Add a push command to Jenkins when tests pass

Used the promote build features.

Basically the integration_test is promoted when the load_test passes
(which itself is dependent on this integration_test passing).

When promoted the containers are built and published.

NOTE: in order for publication to work it is necessary to login to
Docker Hub - see ci/jenkins/jenkins_home/jobs/*/nextBuildNumber - in
order to login run the following command once the jenkins container is
running.

`docker exec ci_jenkins_1 docker login --email="foo@bar.org" --username="foo" --password="bar"`

* TODO Extract common items from docker-compose files

* TODO Rename "java" to "rest"
